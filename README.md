# Kickstarter-analysis

## Overview of Project

Louise successfully secured funds from the campaign to raise money for her play.  Now, Louise wants to know how different types of theatrical events can be performed based on their launch dates and funding goals.  We have a data set of past activities that contains a variety of observations and metrics that we can use to analyze situations similar to these activities at different times and with different goals. 

This new assignment consists of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report to deliver your results. You will submit the following:
Deliverable 1: Outcomes Based on Launch Date Chart
Deliverable 2: Outcomes Based on Goals Chart
Deliverable 3: A written analysis of the results (README.md)

## Purpose

The aim of the project is to help Louise understand how previous fundraising campaigns relate to launch dates and fundraising goals by analysing data sets from similar campaigns in the past. 

## Analysis and Challenges

By looking at the "Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date" line chart above, the successful events start to rise in April, and achieve its peak period in May. Time period before April has the low outcomes of success. And after May, the success rate start to decline significantly. Even though, May has the most success outcomes, it also has the most failed outcomes. But that's probably because this is the peak period for events.

From the line chart above, we can see that less than 1000 has the highest success, almost close to 80%. Goal between 35000 to 40000 also has high success rates. That is indicate there are many other elements may affect the results. In oder to analyze the result more accuratly, it is better to have more elements collected that may affect the results of the events. 

## Conclusions of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

May is the best month of the campaign, even though the success rate start to decline after May. But June and July are good choice as well since they did not decline too badly, still have success rate close to 100. 

## Conclusions of Outcomes Based on Goals

From the data, it is clearly that under 5000 has the most success rate. But that is also means more competitions. 35000 to 40000 is lower than <5000, but the success rate is still looks good. And i believe this range will have less competitions.
